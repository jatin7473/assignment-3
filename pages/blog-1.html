            <p class="blog-thoughts">I've always been curious about Extended Reality (XR). This interesting environment includes virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). These technologies provide immersive experiences that are currently being used in a wide range of environments, including gaming, training, education, healthcare, and industry. What particularly interests me is how XR is changing the way we study, carry out medical operations, and manage activities in industries. It's incredible how XR is transforming how we engage with digital information and places.</p>
