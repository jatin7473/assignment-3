            <p class="blog-thoughts">It was through science papers and tech news that I first learned about this technique. The most exciting part for me is how technology may benefit those with impairments, such as giving them mental control over artificial limbs.

                However, there are also significant issues to take into account, such as privacy and security worries. Nevertheless, I find it fascinating how neural interfaces could alter our future interactions with technology.</p>
